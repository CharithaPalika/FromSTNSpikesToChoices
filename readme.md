# 🧠 Spiking STN–GPe and Basal Ganglia Decision-Making Framework for Normal, PD, and DBS Conditions


## 📌 About This Project  
This repository is also used for the *Brain Modelling Workshop* conducted by **NeuroGATI**.  
Learn more: https://www.neurogati.com/


This repository provides a computational framework for studying **neural synchrony, pathological oscillations, and decision-making behavior** in Normal and Parkinsonian conditions using:

1. 🔹 A **biophysical spiking STN–GPe neural network**, and  
2. 🔹 A **Basal Ganglia decision-making model (Iowa Gambling Task)** that can be driven by either:
   - stochastic noise, or  
   - neural dynamics generated by the STN–GPe system (Normal / PD / DBS conditions)

The approach is inspired by:

> Mandali, A., Rengaswamy, M., Chakravarthy, V. S., & Moustafa, A. A. (2015).  
> **A spiking Basal Ganglia model of synchrony, exploration and decision making.**

## 🔍 Scientific Background  

Basal Ganglia circuits govern:

✔ action selection  
✔ reward learning  
✔ cognitive flexibility  

Dysfunctional synchrony and oscillations in the **STN–GPe loop** underlie symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and impaired decision processing.

This repository enables:

- simulation of STN–GPe system under normal, PD and PD with DBS conditions
- reinforcement learning-based decision experiments
- comparison across **Normal / PD / DBS** neural regimes

## 📌 Repository Components  

This project is modular — each directory has a clear role:

### 📁 `basal_ganglia/`  
Implements Basal Ganglia learning mechanisms and decision-making logic used in the IGT task.

### 📁 `envs/`  
Contains decision making environment: The Iowa Gambling Task.

### 📁 `stn_gpe/`  
Defines the spiking **STN–GPe network model** including:

- network simulation code  
- DBS waveform generation  
- neural analysis tools (entropy, synchrony, firing rate, frequency, spectrograms)

### 📁 `params/`  
Stores YAML configuration files controlling model parameters, such as:

- **STN–GPe conditions:** Normal, PD, DBS  
- **Decision-making settings:** trials, epochs, bins, learning rate


### 📁 `simulations/`  
Example Jupyter notebooks showing:

- STN-GPe dynamics
- Decision making IGT performance
 The codebooks also contain interactive graphical interfaces to carryout the simulations. No coding required — adjust inputs and observe results.
